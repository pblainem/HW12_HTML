 - How to remove the margin from the bottom of what appears to be <nav class="navbar nav">
	 - There is whitespace under the "Latitude" button I would like to get rid of.
 - How do I use a dropdown for the other buttons (I can't get a dropdown to function at all)
 - How to get the buttons to display in-line (this would be in the media query, where I would also float the buttons left.)
